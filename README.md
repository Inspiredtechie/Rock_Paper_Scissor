# ‚úä Rock üñê Paper ‚úå Scissors üéÆ

When I was 10-11 year old, around class 5-6 me and my friends are mad over this unique game of "**ROCK, PAPER & SCISSOR ‚úÇ**". Whenever we want to pass the leisure time we play this game and start having immense joy. If there is an team battle and we want to toss around between both the teams we choose this game to decide which team will get the first chance for choosing the opinion. Now, after passing out of the schools we don't get to play much and it is difficult to find peoples with the same vibe also. So, to make this error fix, I have designed a virtual **Rock-Paper-Scissor** Game using the recent technology of AI, ML and OpenCV.

# Rules:
* If the AI opinion is greater than yours. It scores a point
* If the AI opinion is less than yours . You score a point
* If both the Opinions matches each other. Its a tie
* Press 'S' to start the game each time
* make sure the hand is visible to the camera taking input

# Requirements:
* opencv-python-contrib
* cvzone
* time
* random
* HandDetector
